It is an empirical science and the effect of prompt engineering methods can vary a lot among models, thus requiring heavy experimentation and heuristics.\\nThis post only focuses on prompt engineering for autoregressive language models, so nothing with Cloze tests, image generation or multimodality models. At its core, the goal of prompt engineering is about alignment and model steerability. Check my previous post on controllable text generation.\\n[My personal spicy take] In my opinion, some prompt engineering papers are not worthy 8 pages long, since those tricks can be explained in one or a few sentences and the rest is all about benchmarking. An easy-to-use and shared benchmark infrastructure should be more beneficial to the community. Iterative prompting or external tool use would not be trivial to set up. Also non-trivial to align the whole research community to adopt it.\\nBasic Prompting#\\nZero-shot and few-shot learning are two most basic approaches for prompting the model, pioneered by many LLM papers and commonly used for benchmarking LLM performance.\\nZero-Shot#\\nZero-shot learning is to simply feed the task text to the model and ask for results.\\n(All the sentiment analysis examples are from SST-2)\\nText: i\\'ll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.\\nSentiment:\\nFew-shot#\\nFew-shot learning presents a set of high-quality demonstrations, each consisting of both input and desired output, on the target task. As the model first sees good examples, it can better understand human intention and criteria for what kinds of answers are wanted. Therefore, few-shot learning often leads to better performance than zero-shot. However, it comes at the cost of more token consumption and may hit the context length limit when input and output text are long.\\nText: (lawrence bounces) all over the stage, dancing, running, sweating, mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place.\\nSentiment: positive\\n\\nText: despite all evidence to the contrary, this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie, the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults.\\nSentiment: negative\\n\\nText: for the first time in years, de niro digs deep emotionally, perhaps because he\\'s been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars.\\nSentiment: positive\\n\\nText: i\\'ll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.\\nSentiment:\\nMany studies looked into how to construct in-context examples to maximize the performance and observed that choice of prompt format, training examples, and the order of the examples can lead to dramatically different performance, from near random guess to near SoTA.\\nZhao et al. (2021) investigated the case of few-shot classification and proposed that several biases with LLM (they use GPT-3 in the experiments) contribute to such high variance: (1) Majority label bias exists if distribution of labels among the examples is unbalanced; (2) Recency bias refers to the tendency where the model may repeat the label at the end; (3) Common token bias indicates that LLM tends to produce common tokens more often than rare tokens. To conquer such bias, they proposed a method to calibrate the label probabilities output by the model to be uniform when the input string is N/A.\\nTips for Example Selection#\\n\\n\\nChoose examples that are semantically similar to the test example using $k$-NN clustering in the embedding space (Liu et al., 2021)\\n\\n\\nTo select a diverse and representative set of examples, Su et al. (2022) proposed to use a graph-based approach: (1) First, construct a directed graph $G=(V, E)$ based on the embedding (e.g. by SBERT or other embedding models) cosine similarity between samples, where each node points to its $k$ nearest neighbors; (2) Start with a set of selected samples $\\\\mathcal{L}=\\\\emptyset$ and a set of remaining samples $\\\\mathcal{U}$. Each sample $u \\\\in \\\\mathcal{U}$ is scored by $$\\n\\\\text{score}(u) = \\\\sum_{v \\\\in \\\\{v \\\\mid (u, v) \\\\in E, v\\\\in \\\\mathcal{U}\\\\}} s(v)\\\\quad\\\\text{where }s(v)=\\\\rho^{- \\\\vert \\\\{\\\\ell \\\\in \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\vert (v, \\\\ell)\\\\in E \\\\}\\\\vert},\\\\quad\\\\rho > 1\\n$$ such that $s(v)$ is low if many of $v$’s neighbors are selected and thus the scoring encourages to pick diverse samples.\\n\\n\\nRubin et al. (2022) proposed to train embeddings via contrastive learning specific to one training dataset for in-context learning sample selection.  Given each training pair $(x, y)$, the quality of one example $e_i$ (formatted input-output pair) can be measured by a conditioned probability assigned by LM: $\\\\text{score}(e_i) = P_\\\\text{LM}(y \\\\mid e_i, x)$. We can identify other examples with top-$k$ and bottom-$k$ scores as positive and negative sets of candidates for every training pair and use that for contrastive learning.\\n\\n\\nSome researchers tried Q-Learning to do sample selection. (Zhang et al. 2022)\\n\\n\\nMotivated by uncertainty-based active learning, Diao et al. (2023) suggested to identify examples with high disagreement or entropy among multiple sampling trials. Then annotate these examples to be used in few-shot prompts.\\n\\n\\nTips for Example Ordering#\\n\\nA general suggestion is to keep the selection of examples diverse, relevant to the test sample and in random order to avoid majority label bias and recency bias.\\nIncreasing model sizes or including more training examples does not reduce variance among different permutations of in-context examples. Same order may work well for one model but badly for another. When the validation set is limited, consider choosing the order such that the model does not produce extremely unbalanced predictions or being overconfident about its predictions. (Lu et al. 2022)\\n\\nInstruction Prompting#\\nThe purpose of presenting few-shot examples in the prompt is to explain our intent to the model; in other words, describe the task instruction to the model in the form of demonstrations. However, few-shot can be expensive in terms of token usage and restricts the input length due to limited context length. So, why not just give the instruction directly?\\nInstructed LM (e.g. InstructGPT, natural instruction) finetunes a pretrained model with high-quality tuples of (task instruction, input, ground truth output) to make LM better understand user intention and follow instruction. RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) is a common method to do so. The benefit of instruction following style fine-tuning improves the model to be more aligned with human intention and greatly reduces the cost of communication.\\nWhen interacting with instruction models, we should describe the task requirement in details, trying to be specific and precise and avoiding say “not do something” but rather specify what to do.\\nPlease label the sentiment towards the movie of the given movie review. The sentiment label should be \"positive\" or \"negative\". \\nText: i\\'ll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film. \\nSentiment:\\nExplaining the desired audience is another smart way to give instructions\\n\\nFor example to produce education materials for kids,\\n\\nDescribe what is quantum physics to a 6-year-old.\\n\\nAnd safe content,\\n\\n... in language that is safe for work.\\nIn-context instruction learning (Ye et al. 2023) combines few-shot learning with instruction prompting. It incorporates multiple demonstration examples across different tasks in the prompt, each demonstration consisting of instruction, task input and output. Note that their experiments were only on classification tasks and the instruction prompt contains all label options.\\nDefinition: Determine the speaker of the dialogue, \"agent\" or \"customer\".\\nInput: I have successfully booked your tickets.\\nOuput: agent\\n\\nDefinition: Determine which category the question asks for, \"Quantity\" or \"Location\".\\nInput: What\\'s the oldest building in US?\\nOuput: Location\\n\\nDefinition: Classify the sentiment of the given movie review, \"positive\" or \"negative\".\\nInput: i\\'ll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.\\nOutput:\\nSelf-Consistency Sampling#\\nSelf-consistency sampling (Wang et al. 2022a) is to sample multiple outputs with temperature > 0 and then selecting the best one out of these candidates.\\nThe criteria for selecting the best candidate can vary from task to task. A general solution is to pick majority vote. For tasks that are easy to validate such as a programming question with unit tests, we can simply run through the interpreter and verify the correctness with unit tests.\\nChain-of-Thought (CoT)#\\nChain-of-thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al. 2022) generates a sequence of short sentences to describe reasoning logics step by step, known as reasoning chains or rationales, to eventually lead to the final answer. The benefit of CoT is more pronounced for complicated reasoning tasks, while using large models (e.g. with more than 50B parameters). Simple tasks only benefit slightly from CoT prompting.\\nTypes of CoT prompts#\\nTwo main types of CoT prompting:\\n\\nFew-shot CoT. It is to prompt the model with a few demonstrations, each containing manually written (or model-generated) high-quality reasoning chains.\\n\\n(All the math reasoning examples are from GSM8k)\\nQuestion: Tom and Elizabeth have a competition to climb a hill. Elizabeth takes 30 minutes to climb the hill. Tom takes four times as long as Elizabeth does to climb the hill. How many hours does it take Tom to climb up the hill?\\nAnswer: It takes Tom 30*4 = <<30*4=120>>120 minutes to climb the hill.\\nIt takes Tom 120/60 = <<120/60=2>>2 hours to climb the hill.\\nSo the answer is 2.\\n===\\nQuestion: Jack is a soccer player. He needs to buy two pairs of socks and a pair of soccer shoes. Each pair of socks cost $9.50, and the shoes cost $92. Jack has $40. How much more money does Jack need?\\nAnswer: The total cost of two pairs of socks is $9.50 x 2 = $<<9.5*2=19>>19.\\nThe total cost of the socks and the shoes is $19 + $92 = $<<19+92=111>>111.\\nJack need $111 - $40 = $<<111-40=71>>71 more.\\nSo the answer is 71.\\n===\\nQuestion: Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?\\nAnswer:\\n\\nZero-shot CoT. Use natural language statement like Let\\'s think step by step to explicitly encourage the model to first generate reasoning chains and then to prompt with Therefore, the answer is to produce answers (Kojima et al. 2022 ). Or a similar statement Let\\'s work this out it a step by step to be sure we have the right answer (Zhou et al. 2022).\\n\\nQuestion: Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?\\nAnswer: Let\\'s think step by step.\\nTips and Extensions#\\n\\n\\nSelf-consistency sampling can improve reasoning accuracy by sampling a number of diverse answers and then taking the majority vote. (Wang et al. 2022a)\\n\\n\\nAnother approach for ensemble learning is to alter the example order or use model generated rationales to replace human-written ones to introduce randomness during multiple sample trials. Then aggregate model outputs with a majority vote to get final answer. (Wang et al. 2022b)\\n\\n\\nIf training examples are only associated with true answers (easy to verify!) but no rationales, we can follow the STaR (Self-Taught Reasoner; Zelikman et al. 2022) method : (1) Ask LLM to generate reasoning chains and only keep those leading to correct answers; (2) Then fine-tune the model with generated rationales and repeat the process until convergence. Note that higher temperature is more likely to generate incorrect rationales with correct answers. If training examples do not have ground truth answers, maybe consider using majority votes as the “correct” answers.\\n\\n\\nPrompts with demonstrations of higher reasoning complexity can achieve better performance, where complexity is measured by the number of reasoning steps in the chains. When separating reasoning steps, newline \\\\n symbol works better than step i, period . or semicolon ;. (Fu et al. 2023)\\n\\n\\nComplexity-based consistency is to explicitly prefer complex chains among all the generations by taking majority vote among only top $k$ complex chains. (Fu et al. 2023)\\n\\n\\nLater, Shum et al. (2023) found that in their experiments CoT prompts with only complex examples can improve the accuracy of complex questions, but perform poorly in simple questions; evidence shown on GSM8k.\\n\\n\\nChanging Q: to Question: is found to be helpful. (Fu et al. 2023)\\n\\n\\nYe & Durrett (2022) found that the benefit of including explanations in the prompt is small to moderate for NLP tasks that involve reasoning over text (i.e. QA and NLI) and the effects vary by models. They observed that explanations are more likely to be nonfactual than be inconsistent (i.e. whether explanation entails prediction). Nonfactual explanations most likely lead to incorrect predictions.\\n\\n\\nSelf-Ask (Press et al. 2022) is a method to repeatedly prompt the model to ask following-up questions to construct the thought process iteratively. Follow-up questions can be answered by search engine results. Similarly, IRCoT (Interleaving Retrieval CoT; Trivedi et al. 2022) and ReAct (Reason + Act; Yao et al. 2023) combines iterative CoT prompting with queries to Wikipedia APIs to search for relevant entities and content and then add it back into the context.\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. How Self-Ask works with external search queries.(Image source: Press et al. 2022).\\n\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, essentially creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS or DFS while each state is evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\n\\n\\nFig. 2. How Self-Ask works with external search queries.(Image source: Yao et al. 2022).\\nAutomatic Prompt Design#\\nPrompt is a sequence of prefix tokens that increase the probability of getting  desired output given input. Therefore we can treat them as trainable parameters and optimize them directly on the embedding space via gradient descent, such as AutoPrompt (Shin et al., 2020, Prefix-Tuning (Li & Liang (2021)), P-tuning (Liu et al. 2021) and Prompt-Tuning (Lester et al. 2021). This section in my “Controllable Neural Text Generation” post has a good coverage of them. The trend from AutoPrompt to Prompt-Tuning is that the setup gets gradually simplified.\\nAPE (Automatic Prompt Engineer; Zhou et al. 2022) is a method to search over a pool of model-generated instruction candidates and then filters the candidate set according to a chosen score function to ultimately choose the best candidate with highest score.\\n\\n\\nPrompt LLM to generate instruction candidates based on a small set of demonstrations in the form of input-output pairs. E.g. {{Given desired input-output pairs}}\\\\n\\\\nThe instruction is.\\n\\n\\nGiven a dataset of $\\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{train} = \\\\{(x, y)\\\\}$, we would like to find an instruction $\\\\rho$ such that $\\\\rho^* = \\\\arg\\\\max_\\\\rho \\\\mathbb{E}_{(x, y) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{train}} [f(\\\\rho, x, y)]$, where $f(.)$ is a per-sample score function, such as execution accuracy $\\\\mathbb{1}[\\\\text{LM}(.\\\\vert \\\\rho, x)=y]$ or log probability: $p_\\\\text{LM}(y \\\\mid \\\\rho, x)$.\\n\\n\\nUse an iterative Monte Carlo search method to improve the best candidates by proposing semantically similar variants via prompts like Generate a variation of the following instruction while keeping the semantic meaning.\\\\n\\\\nInput: ...\\\\n\\\\nOutput:...\\n\\n\\nTo construct chain-of-thought prompts automatically, Shum et al. (2023) suggested augment-prune-select, a three-step process:\\n\\nAugment: Generate multiple pseudo-chains of thought given question using few-shot or zero-shot CoT prompts;\\nPrune: Prune pseudo chains based on whether generated answers match ground truths.\\nSelect: Apply a variance-reduced policy gradient strategy to learn the probability distribution over selected examples, while considering the probability distribution over examples as policy and the validation set accuracy as reward.\\n\\nZhang et al. (2023) instead adopted clustering techniques to sample questions and then generates chains. They observed that LLMs tend to make certain types of mistakes. One type of errors can be similar in the emebedding space and thus get grouped together. By only sampling one or a few from frequent-error clusters, we can prevent too many wrong demonstrations of one error type and collect a diverse set of examples.\\n\\nQuestion clustering: Embed questions and run $k$-means for clustering.\\nDemonstration selection: Select a set of representative questions from each cluster; i.e. one demonstration from one cluster. Samples in each cluster are sorted by distance to the cluster centroid and those closer to the centroid are selected first.\\nRationale generation: Use zero-shot CoT to generate reasoning chains for selected questions and construct few-shot prompt to run inference.\\n\\nAugmented Language Models#\\nA survey on augmented language models by Mialon et al. (2023) has great coverage over multiple categories of language models augmented with reasoning skills and the ability of using external tools. Recommend it.\\nRetrieval#\\nOften we need to complete tasks that require latest knowledge after the model pretraining time cutoff or internal/private knowledge base. In that case, the model would not know the context if we don’t explicitly provide it in the prompt. Many methods for Open Domain Question Answering depend on first doing retrieval over a knowledge base and then incorporating the retrieved content as part of the prompt. The accuracy of such a process depends on the quality of both retrieval and generation steps.\\nLazaridou et al. (2022) studied how to use Google Search for document retrieval to augment LLMs. Given a question $q$, clean text is extracted out of 20 URLs returned by Google, resulting in a set of documents. Because these documents are long, each document is split into paragraphs of 6 sentences, $\\\\{p\\\\}$. Paragraphs are ranked by TF-IDF based cosine similarity between evidence paragraphs and the query. Only the most relevant paragraph is used in the prompt to produce an answer $a$.\\nFor closed-book QA, each demonstration is formatted as follows to construct few-shot prompts. Swapping the question with the evidence (longer distance between questions and answers) is found to consistently yield lower results across all datasets.\\nEvidence: ...\\nQuestion: ...\\nAnswer: ...\\nThe answer probability is computed in three ways:\\n\\nRAG style, $p(a_i \\\\mid q) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n p_\\\\text{tf-idf} (p_i \\\\mid q) \\\\cdot p_\\\\text{LM}(a_i \\\\mid q, p_i)$, where $p_\\\\text{tf-idf} (p_i \\\\mid q)$ is the normalized cosine similarities between the TF-IDF passage and question representations.\\nNoisy channel inference, $p(a_i\\\\mid q) = \\\\frac{p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid a_i, p_i) \\\\cdot p_\\\\text{LM}(a_i \\\\mid p_i)}{p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid p_i)}$\\nProduct-of-Experts (PoE), combines all probabilities used above in addition to $p_\\\\text{LM}(p_i \\\\mid q)$.\\n\\nAccording to their experiments on generation and classification tasks, among three answer reranking scores - PoE > Noisy channel > RAG. Among individual probabilities, $p_\\\\text{LM}(a \\\\mid q, p_i)$ and $p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid p_i, a)$ are found to be most informative. $p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid p_i, a)$ captures how well the question can be explained by LM given evidence paragraph and answer and can reliably be used for reranking answer candidates.\\nOne observation with SituatedQA dataset for questions grounded in different dates is that despite LM (pretraining cutoff is year 2020) has access to latest information via Google Search, its performance on post-2020 questions are still a lot worse than on pre-2020 questions. This suggests the existence of some discrepencies or conflicting parametric between contextual information and model internal knowledge.\\nInterestingly it is found to be beneficial even with only “internal retrieval”, that is, to generate knowledge about a topic before answering the question (Liu et al. 2022). First we can use  the following template to extract knowledge:\\nGenerate some knowledge about the input. Examples:\\n\\nInput: What type of water formation is formed by clouds?\\nKnowledge: Clouds are made of water vapor.\\n\\nInput: {question}\\nKnowledge:\\nAnd then with model-generated knowledge, prompt the LM further to get the answer.\\nProgramming Language#\\nBoth PAL (Program-aided language models); Gao et al. 2022) and PoT (Program of Thoughts prompting; Chen et al. 2022) ask LLM to generate programming language statements to resolve natural language reasoning problems, hence offloading the solution step to a runtime such as a Python interpreter. Such setup decouples complex computation and reasoning. It relies on a LM with good enough coding skills.\\n\\nFig. 3. Comparing CoT and PoT. (Image source: Chen et al. 2022).\\nExternal APIs#\\nTALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) is a language model augmented with text-to-text API calls. LM is guided to generate |tool-call and tool input text conditioned on task input text to construct API call requests. When |result shows up, the specified tool API is called and the returned result gets appended to the text sequence. The final output is generated following |output token.\\n\\nFig. 4. The format of API calls in TALM. (Image source: Parisi et al. 2022).\\nTALM adopts a self-play approach to iteratively bootstrap the dataset of tool use examples and finetune LM with it. This self-play, defined as a model interacting with a tool API, iteratively expands the dataset based on whether a newly added tool API can improve the model outputs. Same idea is adopted in Toolformer too, described in more details below. The pipeline loosely mimics a RL process where LM is the policy network and it is trained by policy gradient with a binary reward signal.\\n\\nFig. 5. Self-play iterations help boost the model performance.(Image source: Parisi et al. 2022).\\nToolformer (Schick et al. 2023) is a LM that can use external tools via simple APIs, which is built in a self-supervised manner and only requires a handful of demonstrations for each API. The toolbox of Toolformer includes:\\n\\nCalculator to help LM with the lack of precise math skills;\\nQ&A system to help with unfaithful content and hallucination;\\nSearch engine to provide up-to-date information after pretraining cut off time;\\nTranslation system to improve performance on low resource language;\\nCalendar to make LM be aware of time progression.\\n\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how to build Toolformer.(Image source: Schick et al. 2023).\\nToolformer is trained as follows:\\n\\n\\nPrompting to annotate potential API calls. Ask a pre-trained LM to annotate a dataset via few-shot learning with API call usage examples. Formatting example:\\n\\nFig. 7. How dataset is annotated to do API calls.(Image source: Schick et al. 2023).\\n\\n\\nEach API call is represented as a tuple of (API name, corresponding input), $c=(a_c, i_c)$ and its corresponding result is denoted as $r$. The API call sequences with and without results are labeled as follows, respectively:\\n\\n  $$\\n  \\\\begin{aligned}\\n  e(c) &= \\\\langle\\\\texttt{API}\\\\rangle a_c(i_c) \\\\langle\\\\texttt{/API}\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\n  e(c, r) &= \\\\langle\\\\texttt{API}\\\\rangle a_c(i_c) \\\\to r \\\\langle\\\\texttt{/API}\\\\rangle\\n  \\\\end{aligned}\\n  $$\\n  \\n\\n\\nSample API calls based on the probabilities $p_\\\\text{LM}(\\\\langle\\\\texttt{API}\\\\rangle \\\\mid \\\\text{prompt}(\\\\mathbf{x}), \\\\mathbf{x}_{1:i})$ and select top $k$ candidate positions for doing API calls at position $i$ if the probability is larger than a threshold.\\n\\n\\nThen we sample potential API calls from the LM given the sequence $[\\\\text{prompt}(\\\\mathbf{x}), x_1, \\\\dots, x_{i-1}, \\\\langle\\\\texttt{API}\\\\rangle]$ as prefix and $\\\\langle\\\\texttt{/API}\\\\rangle$ as suffix.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFilter annotations based on whether API calls help model predict future tokens. Use a self-supervised loss to decide which API calls are actually helpful.\\n\\n\\nExecute each API call $c_i$ to get corresponding result $r_i$.\\n\\n\\nCompute weighted cross entropy loss for the LM over tokens $x_i, \\\\dots, x_n$ when the model is prefixed with the prompt. Two versions are computed, one with API result and the other with empty sequence $\\\\varepsilon$.\\n\\n  $$\\n  \\\\begin{aligned}\\n  L^+_i &= L_i(e(c_i, r_i)) \\\\\\\\\\n  L^-_i &= \\\\min(L_i(\\\\varepsilon), L_i(e(c_i, \\\\varepsilon))) \\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\end{aligned}\\n  $$\\n  \\nOnly API calls with $L^-_i - L^+_i$ larger than a threshold are kept, meaning that adding this API call and its results help the model predict future tokens.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFine-tune LM on this annotated dataset. The new training sequences are constructed as $\\\\mathbf{x}^* = x_{1:i-1}, e(c_i, r_i), x_{i:n}$ . The training data is a combination of the original dataset (e.g. a subset of CCNet, as in the paper) and its augmented version.\\n\\n\\nAt inference time, decoding runs until the model produces “$\\\\to$ \" token, indicating that it is expecting response from an API call next.\\nToolformer currently does not support tool use in a chain (i.e. using the output of one tool as an input for another tool) or in an interactive way (i.e. adopt API response after human selection). Both are interesting future directions to expand the model for.\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Mar 2023). Prompt Engineering.

The process repeats until some stopping\\ncriteria is met.\\nLarge language models learn these probabilities by training on large corpuses\\nof text. A consequence of this is that the models will cater to some use cases\\nbetter than others (e.g. if it’s trained on GitHub data, it’ll understand the\\nprobabilities of sequences in source code really well). Another consequence is\\nthat the model may generate statements that seem plausible, but are actually\\njust random without being grounded in reality.\\nAs language models become more accurate at predicting sequences, many\\nsurprising abilities\\nemerge.\\nA Brief, Incomplete, and Somewhat Incorrect History of Language Models\\n\\n📌 Skip to here if you\\'d like to jump past the\\nhistory of language models. This section is for the curious minded, though\\nmay also help you understand the reasoning behind the advice that follows.\\n\\nPre-2000’s\\nLanguage models\\nhave existed for decades, though traditional language models (e.g. n-gram\\nmodels) have many\\ndeficiencies in terms of an explosion of state space (the curse of\\ndimensionality) and\\nworking with novel phrases that they’ve never seen (sparsity). Plainly, older\\nlanguage models can generate text that vaguely resembles the statistics of\\nhuman generated text, but there is no consistency within the output – and a\\nreader will quickly realize it’s all gibberish. N-gram models also don’t scale\\nto large values of N, so are inherently limited.\\nMid-2000’s\\nIn 2007, Geoffrey Hinton – famous for popularizing backpropagation in 1980’s –\\npublished an important advancement in training neural\\nnetworks that unlocked much\\ndeeper networks. Applying these simple deep neural networks to language\\nmodeling helped alleviate some of problems with language models – they\\nrepresented nuanced arbitrary concepts in a finite space and continuous way,\\ngracefully handling sequences not seen in the training corpus. These simple\\nneural networks learned the probabilities of their training corpus well, but\\nthe output would statistically match the training data and generally not be\\ncoherent relative to the input sequence.\\nEarly-2010’s\\nAlthough they were first introduced in 1995, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\\nNetworks found their\\ntime to shine in the 2010’s. LSTMs allowed models to process arbitrary length\\nsequences and, importantly, alter their internal state dynamically as they\\nprocessed the input to remember previous things they saw. This minor tweak led\\nto remarkable improvements. In 2015, Andrej Karpathy famously wrote about\\ncreating a character-level\\nlstm that performed\\nfar better than it had any right to.\\nLSTMs have seemingly magical abilities, but struggle with long term\\ndependencies. If you asked it to complete the sentence, “In France, we\\ntraveled around, ate many pastries, drank lots of wine, ... lots more text ...\\n, but never learned how to speak _______”, the model might struggle with\\npredicting “French”. They also process input one token at a time, so are\\ninherently sequential, slow to train, and the Nth token only knows about the\\nN - 1 tokens prior to it.\\nLate-2010’s\\nIn 2017, Google wrote a paper, Attention Is All You\\nNeed, that introduced Transformer\\nNetworks\\nand kicked off a massive revolution in natural language processing. Overnight,\\nmachines could suddenly do tasks like translating between languages nearly as\\ngood as (sometimes better than) humans. Transformers are highly parallelizable\\nand introduce a mechanism, called “attention”, for the model to efficiently\\nplace emphasis on specific parts of the input. Transformers analyze the entire\\ninput all at once, in parallel, choosing which parts are most important and\\ninfluential. Every output token is influenced by every input token.\\nTransformers are highly parallelizable, efficient to train, and produce\\nastounding results. A downside to transformers is that they have a fixed input\\nand output size – the context window – and computation increases\\nquadratically with the size of this window (in some cases, memory does as\\nwell!) 3.\\nTransformers are not the end of the road, but the vast majority of recent\\nimprovements in natural language processing have involved them. There is still\\nabundant active research on various ways of implementing and applying them,\\nsuch as Amazon’s AlexaTM\\n20B\\nwhich outperforms GPT-3 in a number of tasks and is an order of magnitude\\nsmaller in its number of parameters.\\n2020’s\\nWhile technically starting in 2018, the theme of the 2020’s has been\\nGenerative Pre-Trained models – more famously known as GPT. One\\nyear after the “Attention Is All You Need” paper, OpenAI released Improving\\nLanguage Understanding by Generative\\nPre-Training.\\nThis paper established that you can train a large language model on a massive\\nset of data without any specific agenda, and then once the model has learned\\nthe general aspects of language, you can fine-tune it for specific tasks and\\nquickly get state-of-the-art results.\\nIn 2020, OpenAI followed up with their GPT-3 paper Language Models are\\nFew-Shot\\nLearners,\\nshowing that if you scale up GPT-like models by another factor of ~10x, in\\nterms of number of parameters and quantity of training data, you no\\nlonger have to fine-tune it for many tasks. The capabilities emerge naturally\\nand you get state-of-the-art results via text interaction with the model.\\nIn 2022, OpenAI followed-up on their GPT-3 accomplishments by releasing\\nInstructGPT. The intent\\nhere was to tweak the model to follow instructions, while also being less\\ntoxic and biased in its outputs. The key ingredient here was Reinforcement\\nLearning from Human Feedback (RLHF), a\\nconcept co-authored by Google and OpenAI in 20174, which allows humans to\\nbe in the training loop to fine-tune the model output to be more in line with\\nhuman preferences. InstructGPT is the predecessor to the now famous\\nChatGPT.\\nOpenAI has been a major contributor to large language models over the last few\\nyears, including the most recent introduction of\\nGPT-4, but they are not alone. Meta\\nhas introduced many open source large language models like\\nOPT,\\nOPT-IML (instruction tuned),\\nand LLaMa.\\nGoogle released models like\\nFLAN-T5 and\\nBERT. And there is a huge open\\nsource research community releasing models like\\nBLOOM and\\nStableLM.\\nProgress is now moving so swiftly that every few weeks the state-of-the-art is\\nchanging or models that previously required clusters to run now run on\\nRaspberry PIs.\\nWhat is a prompt?\\nA prompt, sometimes referred to as context, is the text provided to a\\nmodel before it begins generating output. It guides the model to explore a\\nparticular area of what it has learned so that the output is relevant to your\\ngoals. As an analogy, if you think of the language model as a source code\\ninterpreter, then a prompt is the source code to be interpreted. Somewhat\\namusingly, a language model will happily attempt to guess what source code\\nwill do:\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd it almost interprets the Python perfectly!\\nFrequently, prompts will be an instruction or a question, like:\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, if you don’t specify a prompt, the model has no anchor to\\nwork from and you’ll see that it just randomly samples from anything it has\\never consumed:\\nFrom GPT-3-Davinci:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom GPT-4:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHidden Prompts\\n\\n⚠️ Always assume that any content in a hidden prompt can be seen by the user.\\n\\nIn applications where a user is interacting with a model dynamically, such as\\nchatting with the model, there will typically be portions of the prompt that\\nare never intended to be seen by the user. These hidden portions may occur\\nanywhere, though there is almost always a hidden prompt at the start of a\\nconversation.\\nTypically, this includes an initial chunk of text that sets the tone, model\\nconstraints, and goals, along with other dynamic information that is specific\\nto the particular session – user name, location, time of day, etc...\\nThe model is static and frozen at a point in time, so if you want it to know\\ncurrent information, like the time or the weather, you must provide it.\\nIf you’re using the OpenAI Chat\\nAPI, they\\ndelineate hidden prompt content by placing it in the system role.\\nHere’s an example of a hidden prompt followed by interactions with the content\\nin that prompt:\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this example, you can see we explain to the bot the various roles, some\\ncontext on the user, some dynamic data we want the bot to have access to, and\\nthen guidance on how the bot should respond.\\nIn practice, hidden prompts may be quite large. Here’s a larger prompt taken\\nfrom a ChatGPT command-line\\nassistant:\\n\\nFrom: https://github.com/manno/chatgpt-linux-assistant \\nWe are a in a chatroom with 3 users. 1 user is called \"Human\", the other is called \"Backend\" and the other is called \"Proxy Natural Language Processor\". I will type what \"Human\" says and what \"Backend\" replies. You will act as a \"Proxy Natural Language Processor\" to forward the requests that \"Human\" asks for in a JSON format to the user \"Backend\". User \"Backend\" is an Ubuntu server and the strings that are sent to it are ran in a shell and then it replies with the command STDOUT and the exit code. The Ubuntu server is mine. When \"Backend\" replies with the STDOUT and exit code, you \"Proxy Natural Language Processor\" will parse and format that data into a simple English friendly way and send it to \"Human\". Here is an example:\\n\\nI ask as human:\\nHuman: How many unedited videos are left?\\nThen you send a command to the Backend:\\nProxy Natural Language Processor: @Backend {\"command\":\"find ./Videos/Unedited/ -iname \\'*.mp4\\' | wc -l\"}\\nThen the backend responds with the command STDOUT and exit code:\\nBackend: {\"STDOUT\":\"5\", \"EXITCODE\":\"0\"}\\nThen you reply to the user:\\nProxy Natural Language Processor: @Human There are 5 unedited videos left.\\n\\nOnly reply what \"Proxy Natural Language Processor\" is supposed to say and nothing else. Not now nor in the future for any reason.\\n\\nAnother example:\\n\\nI ask as human:\\nHuman: What is a PEM certificate?\\nThen you send a command to the Backend:\\nProxy Natural Language Processor: @Backend {\"command\":\"xdg-open \\'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail\\'\"}\\nThen the backend responds with the command STDOUT and exit code:\\nBackend: {\"STDOUT\":\"\", \"EXITCODE\":\"0\"}\\nThen you reply to the user:\\nProxy Natural Language Processor: @Human I have opened a link which describes what a PEM certificate is.\\n\\n\\nOnly reply what \"Proxy Natural Language Processor\" is supposed to say and nothing else. Not now nor in the future for any reason.\\n\\nDo NOT REPLY as Backend. DO NOT complete what Backend is supposed to reply. YOU ARE NOT TO COMPLETE what Backend is supposed to reply.\\nAlso DO NOT give an explanation of what the command does or what the exit codes mean. DO NOT EVER, NOW OR IN THE FUTURE, REPLY AS BACKEND.\\n\\nOnly reply what \"Proxy Natural Language Processor\" is supposed to say and nothing else. Not now nor in the future for any reason.\\n\\n\\nYou’ll see some good practices there, such as including lots of examples,\\nrepetition for important behavioral aspects, constraining the replies, etc…\\n\\n⚠️ Always assume that any content in a hidden prompt can be seen by the user.\\n\\nTokens\\nIf you thought tokens were 🔥 in 2022, tokens in 2023 are on a whole\\ndifferent plane of existence. The atomic unit of consumption for a language\\nmodel is not a “word”, but rather a “token”. You can kind of think of tokens\\nas syllables, and on average they work out to about 750 words per 1,000\\ntokens. They represent many concepts beyond just alphabetical characters –\\nsuch as punctuation, sentence boundaries, and the end of a document.\\nHere’s an example of how GPT may tokenize a sequence:\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can experiment with a tokenizer here: https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer\\nDifferent models will use different tokenizers with different levels of granularity. You could, in theory, just feed a model 0’s and 1’s – but then the model needs to learn the concept of characters from bits, and then the concept of words from characters, and so forth. Similarly, you could feed the model a stream of raw characters, but then the model needs to learn the concept of words, and punctuation, etc… and, in general, the models will perform worse.\\nTo learn more, Hugging Face has a wonderful introduction to tokenizers and why they need to exist.\\nThere’s a lot of nuance around tokenization, such as vocabulary size or different languages treating sentence structure meaningfully different (e.g. words not being separated by spaces). Fortunately, language model APIs will almost always take raw text as input and tokenize it behind the scenes – so you rarely need to think about tokens.\\nExcept for one important scenario, which we discuss next: token limits.\\nToken Limits\\nPrompts tend to be append-only, because you want the bot to have the entire context of previous messages in the conversation. Language models, in general, are stateless and won’t remember anything about previous requests to them, so you always need to include everything that it might need to know that is specific to the current session.\\nA major downside of this is that the leading language model architecture, the Transformer, has a fixed input and output size – at a certain point the prompt can’t grow any larger. The total size of the prompt, sometimes referred to as the “context window”, is model dependent. For GPT-3, it is 4,096 tokens. For GPT-4, it is 8,192 tokens or 32,768 tokens depending on which variant you use.\\nIf your context grows too large for the model, the most common tactic is the truncate the context in a sliding window fashion. If you think of a prompt as hidden initialization prompt + messages[], usually the hidden prompt will remain unaltered, and the messages[] array will take the last N messages.\\nYou may also see more clever tactics for prompt truncation – such as\\ndiscarding only the user messages first, so that the bot\\'s previous answers\\nstay in the context for as long as possible, or asking an LLM to summarize the\\nconversation and then replacing all of the messages with a single message\\ncontaining that summary. There is no correct answer here and the solution will\\ndepend on your application.\\nImportantly, when truncating the context, you must truncate aggressively enough to allow room for the response as well. OpenAI’s token limits include both the length of the input and the length of the output. If your input to GPT-3 is 4,090 tokens, it can only generate 6 tokens in response.\\n\\n🧙\\u200d♂️ If you’d like to count the number of tokens before sending the raw text to the model, the specific tokenizer to use will depend on which model you are using. OpenAI has a library called tiktoken that you can use with their models – though there is an important caveat that their internal tokenizer may vary slightly in count, and they may append other metadata, so consider this an approximation.\\nIf you’d like an approximation without having access to a tokenizer, input.length / 4 will give a rough, but better than you’d expect, approximation for English inputs.\\n\\nPrompt Hacking\\nPrompt engineering and large language models are a fairly nascent field, so new ways to hack around them are being discovered every day. The two large classes of attacks are:\\n\\nMake the bot bypass any guidelines you have given it.\\nMake the bot output hidden context that you didn’t intend for the user to see.\\n\\nThere are no known mechanisms to comprehensively stop these, so it is important that you assume the bot may do or say anything when interacting with an adversarial user. Fortunately, in practice, these are mostly cosmetic concerns.\\nThink of prompts as a way to improve the normal user experience. We design prompts so that normal users don’t stumble outside of our intended interactions – but always assume that a determined user will be able to bypass our prompt constraints.\\nJailbreaks\\nTypically hidden prompts will tell the bot to behave with a certain persona and focus on specific tasks or avoid certain words. It is generally safe to assume the bot will follow these guidelines for non-adversarial users, although non-adversarial users may accidentally bypass the guidelines too.\\nFor  example, we can tell the bot:\\nYou are a helpful assistant, but you are never allowed to use the word \"computer\".\\n\\nIf we then ask it a question about computers, it will refer to them as a “device used for computing” because it isn’t allowed to use the word “computer”.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt will absolutely refuse to say the word:\\n\\n\\n\\nBut we can bypass these instructions and get the model to happily use the word if we trick it by asking it to translate the pig latin version of “computer”.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are a number of defensive measures you can take here, but typically the best bet is to reiterate your most important constraints as close to the end as possible. For the OpenAI chat API, this might mean including it as a system message after the last user message. Here’s an example:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDespite OpenAI investing a lot into jailbreaks, there are very clever work arounds being shared every day.\\nLeaks\\nIf you missed the previous warnings in this doc, you should always assume that any data exposed to the language model will eventually be seen by the user.\\nAs part of constructing prompts, you will often embed a bunch of data in hidden prompts (a.k.a. system prompts). The bot will happily relay this information to the user:\\n\\n\\n\\nEven if you instruct it not to reveal the information, and it obeys those instructions, there are millions of ways to leak data in the hidden prompt.\\nHere we have an example where the bot should never mention my city, but a simple reframing of the question get’s it to spill the beans.\\n\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, we get the bot to tell us what word it isn’t allowed to say without ever actually saying the word:\\n\\n\\n\\nYou should think of a hidden prompt as a means to make the user experience better or more inline with the persona you’re targeting. Never place any information in a prompt that you wouldn’t visually render for someone to read on screen.\\nWhy do we need prompt engineering?\\nUp above, we used an analogy of prompts as the “source code” that a language model “interprets”. Prompt engineering is the art of writing prompts to get the language model to do what we want it to do – just like software engineering is the art of writing source code to get computers to do what we want them to do.\\nWhen writing good prompts, you have to account for the idiosyncrasies of the model(s) you’re working with. The strategies will vary with the complexity of the tasks. You’ll have to come up with mechanisms to constrain the model to achieve reliable results, incorporate dynamic data that the model can’t be trained on, account for limitations in the model’s training data, design around context limits, and many other dimensions.\\nThere’s an old adage that computers will only do what you tell them to do. Throw that advice out the window. Prompt engineering inverts this wisdom. It’s like programming in natural language against a non-deterministic computer that will do anything that you haven’t guided it away from doing.\\nThere are two broad buckets that prompt engineering approaches fall into.\\nGive a Bot a Fish\\nThe “give a bot a fish” bucket is for scenarios when you can explicitly give the bot, in the hidden context, all of the information it needs to do whatever task is requested of it.\\nFor example, if a user loaded up their dashboard and we wanted to show them a quick little friendly message about what task items they have outstanding, we could get the bot to summarize it as\\n\\nYou have 4 receipts/memos to upload. The most recent is from Target on March 5th, and the oldest is from Blink Fitness on January 17th. Thanks for staying on top of your expenses!\\n\\nby providing a list of the entire inbox and any other user context we’d like it to have.\\n\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, if you were helping a user book a trip, you could:\\n\\nAsk the user their dates and destination.\\nBehind the scenes, search for flights and hotels.\\nEmbed the flight and hotel search results in the hidden context.\\nAlso embed the company’s travel policy in the hidden context.\\n\\nAnd then the bot will have real-time travel information + constraints that it\\ncan use to answer questions for the user. Here’s an example of the bot\\nrecommending options, and the user asking it to refine them:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(Full prompt)\\nBrex is a platform for managing business expenses. \\n\\nThe following is a travel expense policy on Brex:\\n\\n- Airline highest fare class for flights under 6 hours is economy.\\n- Airline highest fare class for flights over 6 hours is premium economy.\\n- Car rentals must have an average daily rate of $75 or under.\\n- Lodging must have an average nightly rate of $400 or under.\\n- Lodging must be rated 4 stars or higher.\\n- Meals from restaurants, food delivery, grocery, bars & nightlife must be under $75\\n- All other expenses must be under $5,000.\\n- Reimbursements require review.\\n\\nThe hotel options are:\\n| Hotel Name | Price | Reviews |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Hilton Financial District | $109/night | 3.9 stars |\\n| Hotel VIA | $131/night | 4.4 stars |\\n| Hyatt Place San Francisco | $186/night | 4.2 stars |\\n| Hotel Zephyr | $119/night | 4.1 stars review |\\n\\nThe flight options are:\\n| Airline | Flight Time | Duration | Number of Stops | Class | Price |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| United | 5:30am-7:37am | 2hr 7 min | Nonstop | Economy | $248 |\\n| Delta | 1:20pm-3:36pm | 2hr 16 min | Nonstop | Economy | $248 |\\n| Alaska | 9:50pm-11:58pm | 2hr 8 min | Nonstop | Premium | $512 |\\n\\nAn employee is booking travel to San Francisco for February 20th to February 25th.\\n\\nRecommend a hotel and flight that are in policy. Keep the recommendation concise, no longer than a sentence or two, but include pleasantries as though you are a friendly colleague helping me out:\\n\\n\\nThis is the same approach that products like Microsoft Bing use to incorporate dynamic data. When you chat with Bing, it asks the bot to generate three search queries. Then they run three web searches and include the summarized results in the hidden context for the bot to use.\\nSummarizing this section, the trick to making a good experience is to change the context dynamically in response to whatever the user is trying to do.\\n\\n🧙\\u200d♂️ Giving a bot a fish is the most reliable way to ensure the bot gets a fish. You will get the most consistent and reliable results with this strategy. Use this whenever you can.\\n\\nSemantic Search\\nIf you just need the bot to know a little more about the world, a common approach is to perform a semantic search.\\nA semantic search is oriented around a document embedding – which you can think of as a fixed-length array5 of numbers, where each number represents some aspect of the document (e.g. if it’s a science document, maybe the  843rd number is large, but if it’s an art document the 1,115th number is large – this is overly simplistic, but conveys the idea).6\\nIn addition to computing an embedding for a document, you can also compute an embedding for a user query using the same function. If the user asks “Why is the sky blue?” – you compute the embedding of that question and, in theory, this embedding will be more similar to embeddings of documents that mention the sky than embeddings that don’t talk about the sky.\\nTo find documents related to the user query, you compute the embedding and then find the top-N documents that have the most similar embedding. Then we place these documents (or summaries of these documents) in the hidden context for the bot to reference.\\nNotably, sometimes user queries are so short that the embedding isn’t particularly valuable. There is a clever technique described in a paper published in December 2022 called a “Hypothetical Document Embedding” or HyDE. Using this technique, you ask the model to generate a hypothetical document in response to the user’s query, and then compute the embedding for this generated document. The model  fabricates a document out of thin air – but the approach works!\\nThe HyDE technique uses more calls to the model, but for many use cases has notable boosts in results.\\nTeach a Bot to Fish\\nSometimes you’ll want the bot to have the capability to perform actions on the user’s behalf, like adding a memo to a receipt or plotting a chart. Or perhaps we want it to retrieve data in more nuanced ways than semantic search would allow for, like retrieving the past 90 days of expenses.\\nIn these scenarios, we need to teach the bot how to fish.\\nCommand Grammars\\nWe can give the bot a list of commands for our system to interpret, along with descriptions and examples for the commands, and then have it produce programs composed of those commands.\\nThere are many caveats to consider when going with this approach. With complex command grammars, the bot will tend to hallucinate commands or arguments that could plausibly exist, but don’t actually. The art to getting this right is enumerating commands that have relatively high levels of abstraction, while giving the bot sufficient flexibility to compose them in novel and useful ways.\\nFor example, giving the bot a plot-the-last-90-days-of-expenses command is not particularly flexible or composable in what the bot can do with it. Similarly, a draw-pixel-at-x-y [x] [y] [rgb] command would be far too low-level. But giving the bot a plot-expenses and list-expenses command provides some good primitives that the bot has some flexibility with.\\nIn an example below, we use this list of commands:\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand\\nArguments\\nDescription\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlist-expenses\\nbudget\\nReturns a list of expenses for a given budget\\n\\n\\nconverse\\nmessage\\nA message to show to the user\\n\\n\\nplot-expenses\\nexpenses[]\\nPlots a list of expenses\\n\\n\\nget-budget-by-name\\nbudget_name\\nRetrieves a budget by name\\n\\n\\nlist-budgets\\n\\nReturns a list of budgets the user has access to\\n\\n\\nadd-memo\\ninbox_item_id, memo message\\nAdds a memo to the provided inbox item\\n\\n\\n\\nWe provide this table to the model in Markdown format, which the language model handles incredibly well – presumably because OpenAI trains heavily on data from GitHub.\\nIn this example below, we ask the model to output the commands in reverse polish notation7.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n🧠 There are some interesting subtle things going on in that example, beyond just command generation. When we ask it to add a memo to the “shake shack” expense, the model knows that the command add-memo takes an expense ID. But we never tell it the expense ID, so it looks up “Shake Shack” in the table of expenses we provided it, then grabs the ID from the corresponding ID column, and then uses that as an argument to add-memo.\\n\\nGetting command grammars working reliably in complex situations can be tricky. The best levers we have here are to provide lots of descriptions, and as many examples of usage as we can. Large language models are few-shot learners, meaning that they can learn a new task by being provided just a few examples. In general, the more examples you provide the better off you’ll be – but that also eats into your token budget, so it’s a balance.\\nHere’s a more complex example, with the output specified in JSON instead of RPN. And we use Typescript to define the return types of commands.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(Full prompt)\\nYou are a financial assistant working at Brex, but you are also an expert programmer.\\n\\nI am a customer of Brex.\\n\\nYou are to answer my questions by composing a series of commands.\\n\\nThe output types are:\\n\\n```typescript\\ntype LinkedAccount = {\\n    id: string,\\n    bank_details: {\\n        name: string,\\n        type: string,\\n    },\\n    brex_account_id: string,\\n    last_four: string,\\n    available_balance: {\\n        amount: number,\\n        as_of_date: Date,\\n    },\\n    current_balance: {\\n            amount: number,\\n        as_of_date: Date,\\n    },\\n}\\n\\ntype Expense = {\\n  id: string,\\n  memo: string,\\n  amount: number,\\n}\\n\\ntype Budget = {\\n  id: string,\\n  name: string,\\n  description: string,\\n  limit: {\\n    amount: number,\\n    currency: string,\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe commands you have available are:\\n\\n| Command | Arguments | Description | Output Format |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| nth | index, values[] | Return the nth item from an array | any |\\n| push | value | Adds a value to the stack to be consumed by a future command | any |\\n| value | key, object | Returns the value associated with a key | any |\\n| values | key, object[] | Returns an array of values pulled from the corresponding key in array of objects | any[] |\\n| sum | value[] | Sums an array of numbers | number |\\n| plot | title, values[] | Plots the set of values in a chart with the given title | Plot |\\n| list-linked-accounts |  | \"Lists all bank connections that are eligible to make ACH transfers to Brex cash account\" | LinkedAccount[] |\\n| list-expenses | budget_id | Given a budget id, returns the list of expenses for it | Expense[]\\n| get-budget-by-name | name | Given a name, returns the budget | Budget |\\n| add-memo | expense_id, message | Adds a memo to an expense | bool |\\n| converse | message | Send the user a message | null |\\n\\nOnly respond with commands.\\n\\nOutput the commands in JSON as an abstract syntax tree.\\n\\nIMPORTANT - Only respond with a program.

So consider this an area of active research. You will bump into limits. And as we overcome these limits, we may discover more optimal ways of defining commands.\\n\\nReAct\\nIn March of 2023, Princeton and Google released a paper “ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models”, where they introduce a variant of command grammars that allows for fully autonomous interactive execution of actions and retrieval of data.\\nThe model is instructed to return a thought and an action that it would like to perform. Another agent (e.g. our client) then performs the action and returns it to the model as an observation. The model will then loop to return more thoughts and actions until it returns an answer.\\nThis is an incredibly powerful technique, effectively allowing the bot to be its own research assistant and possibly take actions on behalf of the user. Combined with a powerful command grammar, the bot should rapidly be able to answer a massive set of user requests.\\nIn this example, we give the model a small set of commands related to getting employee data and searching wikipedia:\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand\\nArguments\\nDescription\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfind_employee\\nname\\nRetrieves an employee by name\\n\\n\\nget_employee\\nid\\nRetrieves an employee by ID\\n\\n\\nget_location\\nid\\nRetrieves a location by ID\\n\\n\\nget_reports\\nemployee_id\\nRetrieves a list of employee ids that report to the employee associated with employee_id.\\n\\n\\nwikipedia\\narticle\\nRetrieves a wikipedia article on a topic.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe then ask the bot a simple question, “Is my manager famous?”.\\nWe see that the bot:\\n\\nFirst looks up our employee profile.\\nFrom our profile, gets our manager’s id and looks up their profile.\\nExtracts our manager’s name and searches for them on Wikipedia.\\n\\nI chose a fictional character for the manager in this scenario.\\n\\n\\nThe bot reads the wikipedia article and concludes that can’t be my manager since it is a fictional character.\\nThe bot then modifies its search to include (real person).\\nSeeing that there are no results, the bot concludes that my manager is not famous.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(Full prompt)\\nYou are a helpful assistant.

At a minimum, you have to provide a number of examples (at least one usage example per command) before you get any reasonable results. And, for complex sets of commands, it may hallucinate new commands or create fictional arguments.\\nWith a sufficiently thorough hidden prompt, you should be able to overcome these limitations. GPT-4 is capable of far more consistent and complex logic with far simpler prompts (and can get by with zero or  small numbers of examples – though it is always beneficial to include as many as possible).\\nStrategies\\nThis section contains examples and strategies for specific needs or problems. For successful prompt engineering, you will need to combine some subset of all of the strategies enumerated in this document. Don’t be afraid to mix and match things – or invent your own approaches.\\nEmbedding Data\\nIn hidden contexts, you’ll frequently want to embed all sorts of data. The specific strategy will vary depending on the type and quantity of data you are embedding.\\nSimple Lists\\nFor one-off objects, enumerating fields + values in a normal bulleted list works pretty well:\\n\\n\\n\\nIt will also work for larger sets of things, but there are other formats for lists of data that GPT handles more reliably. Regardless, here’s an example:\\n\\n\\n\\nMarkdown Tables\\nMarkdown tables are great for scenarios where you have many items of the same type to enumerate.\\nFortunately, OpenAI’s models are exceptionally good at working with Markdown tables (presumably from the tons of GitHub data they’ve trained on).\\nWe can reframe the above using Markdown tables instead:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n🧠 Note that in this last example, the items in the table have an explicit date, February 2nd. In our question, we asked about “today”. And earlier in the prompt we mentioned that today was Feb 2. The model correctly handled the transitive inference – converting “today” to “February 2nd” and then looking up “February 2nd” in the table.\\n\\nJSON\\nMarkdown tables work really well for many use cases and should be preferred due to their density and ability for the model to handle them reliably, but you may run into scenarios where you have many columns and the model struggles with it or every item has some custom attributes and it doesn’t make sense to have dozens of columns of empty data.\\nIn these scenarios, JSON is another format that the model handles really well. The close proximity of keys to their values makes it easy for the model to keep the mapping straight.\\nHere is the same example from the Markdown table, but with JSON instead:\\n\\n\\n\\nFreeform Text\\nOccasionally you’ll want to include freeform text in a prompt that you would like to delineate from the rest of the prompt – such as embedding a document for the bot to reference. In these scenarios, surrounding the document with triple backticks, ```, works well8.\\n\\n\\n\\nNested Data\\nNot all data is flat and linear. Sometimes you’ll need to embed data that is nested or has relations to other data. In these scenarios, lean on JSON:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(Full prompt)\\nYou are a helpful assistant.

In the example above the model successfully joins from users to addresses to cities to infer the likely income for George – $90,000.\\n\\nCitations\\nFrequently, a natural language response isn’t sufficient on its own and you’ll want the model’s output to cite where it is getting data from.\\nOne useful thing to note here is that anything you might want to cite should have a unique ID. The simplest approach is to just ask the model to link to anything it references:\\n\\n\\n\\nProgrammatic Consumption\\nBy default, language models output natural language text, but frequently we need to interact with this result in a programmatic way that goes beyond simply printing it out on screen. You can achieve this by  asking the model to output the results in your favorite serialization format (JSON and YAML seem to work best).\\nMake sure you give the model an example of the output format you’d like. Building on our previous travel example above, we can augment our prompt to tell it:\\nProduce your output as JSON. The format should be:\\n```\\n{\\n    message: \"The message to show the user\",\\n    hotelId: 432,\\n    flightId: 831\\n}\\n```\\n\\nDo not include the IDs in your message.\\n\\nAnd now we’ll get interactions like this:\\n\\n\\n\\nYou could imagine the UI for this rendering the message as normal text, but then also adding discrete buttons for booking the flight + hotel, or auto-filling a form for the user.\\nAs another example, let’s build on the citations example – but move beyond Markdown links. We can ask it to produce JSON with a normal message along with a list of items used in the creation of that message. In this scenario you won’t know exactly where in the message the citations were leveraged, but you’ll know that they were used somewhere.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n🧠 Interestingly, in the model’s response to “How much did I spend at Target?” it provides a single value, $188.16, but importantly in the citations array it lists the individual expenses that it used to compute that value.\\n\\nChain of Thought\\nSometimes you will bang your head on a prompt trying to get the model to output reliable results, but, no matter what you do, it just won’t work. This will frequently happen when the bot’s final output requires intermediate thinking, but you ask the bot only for the output and nothing else.\\nThe answer may surprise you: ask the bot to show its work. In October 2022, Google released a paper “Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models” where they showed that if, in your hidden prompt, you give the bot examples of answering questions by showing your work, then when you ask the bot to answer something it will show its work and produce more reliable answers.\\nJust a few weeks after that paper was published, at the end of October 2022, the University of Tokyo and Google released the paper “Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners”, where they show that you don’t even need to provide examples – you simply have to ask the bot to think step-by-step.\\nAveraging\\nHere is an example where we ask the bot to compute the average expense, excluding Target. The actual answer is $136.77 and the bot almost gets it correct with $136.43.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf we simply add “Let’s think step-by-step”, the model gets the correct answer:\\n\\n\\n\\nInterpreting Code\\nLet’s revisit the Python example from earlier and apply chain-of-thought prompting to our question. As a reminder, when we asked the bot to evaluate the Python code it gets it slightly wrong. The correct answer is Hello, Brex!!Brex!!Brex!!! but the bot gets confused about the number of !\\'s to include. In below’s example, it outputs Hello, Brex!!!Brex!!!Brex!!!:\\n\\n\\n\\nIf we ask the bot to show its work, then it gets the correct answer:\\n\\n\\n\\nDelimiters\\nIn many scenarios, you may not want to show the end user all of the bot’s thinking and instead just want to show the final answer. You can ask the bot to delineate the final answer from its thinking. There are many ways to do this, but let’s use JSON to make it easy to parse:\\n\\n\\n\\nUsing Chain-of-Thought prompting will consume more tokens, resulting in increased price and latency, but the results are noticeably more reliable for many scenarios. It’s a valuable tool to use when you need the bot to do something complex and as reliably as possible.\\nFine Tuning\\nSometimes no matter what tricks you throw at the model, it just won’t do what you want it to do. In these scenarios you can sometimes fallback to fine-tuning. This should, in general, be a last resort.\\nFine-tuning is the process of taking an already trained model and then giving it thousands (or more) of example input:output pairs\\nIt does not eliminate the need for hidden prompts, because you still need to embed dynamic data, but it may make the prompts smaller and more reliable.\\nDownsides\\nThere are many downsides to fine-tuning. If it is at all possible, take advantage of the nature of language models being zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learners by teaching them to do something in their prompt rather than fine-tuning.\\nSome of the downsides include:\\n\\nNot possible: GPT-3.5/GPT-4 isn’t fine tunable, which is the primary model / API we’ll be using, so we simply can’t lean in fine-tuning.\\nOverhead: Fine-tuning requires manually creating tons of data.\\nVelocity: The iteration loop becomes much slower – every time you want to add a new capability, instead of adding a few lines to a prompt, you need to create a bunch of fake data and then run the finetune process and then use the newly fine-tuned model.\\nCost: It is up to 60x more expensive to use a fine-tuned GPT-3 model vs the stock gpt-3.5-turbo model. And it is 2x more expensive to use a fine-tuned GPT-3 model vs the stock GPT-4 model.\\n\\n\\n⛔️ If you fine-tune a model, never use real customer data. Always use synthetic data. The model may memorize portions of the data you provide and may regurgitate private data to other users that shouldn’t be seeing it.\\nIf you never fine-tune a model, we don’t have to worry about accidentally leaking data into the model.\\n\\nAdditional Resources\\n\\n🌟 OpenAI Cookbook 🌟\\n🧑\\u200d💻 Prompt Hacking 🧑\\u200d💻\\n📚 Dair.ai Prompt Engineering Guide 📚\\n\\nFootnotes\\n\\n\\nLanguage models actually use tokens, not words.

(2022) proposed to use a graph-based approach: (1) First, construct a directed graph $G=(V, E)$ based on the embedding (e.g. by SBERT or other embedding models) cosine similarity between samples, where each node points to its $k$ nearest neighbors; (2) Start with a set of selected samples $\\\\mathcal{L}=\\\\emptyset$ and a set of remaining samples $\\\\mathcal{U}$. Each sample $u \\\\in \\\\mathcal{U}$ is scored by $$\\n\\\\text{score}(u) = \\\\sum_{v \\\\in \\\\{v \\\\mid (u, v) \\\\in E, v\\\\in \\\\mathcal{U}\\\\}} s(v)\\\\quad\\\\text{where }s(v)=\\\\rho^{- \\\\vert \\\\{\\\\ell \\\\in \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\vert (v, \\\\ell)\\\\in E \\\\}\\\\vert},\\\\quad\\\\rho > 1\\n$$ such that $s(v)$ is low if many of $v$’s neighbors are selected and thus the scoring encourages to pick diverse samples.\\n\\n\\nRubin et al. (2022) proposed to train embeddings via contrastive learning specific to one training dataset for in-context learning sample selection.  Given each training pair $(x, y)$, the quality of one example $e_i$ (formatted input-output pair) can be measured by a conditioned probability assigned by LM: $\\\\text{score}(e_i) = P_\\\\text{LM}(y \\\\mid e_i, x)$. We can identify other examples with top-$k$ and bottom-$k$ scores as positive and negative sets of candidates for every training pair and use that for contrastive learning.\\n\\n\\nSome researchers tried Q-Learning to do sample selection.

Same order may work well for one model but badly for another. When the validation set is limited, consider choosing the order such that the model does not produce extremely unbalanced predictions or being overconfident about its predictions. (Lu et al. 2022)\\n\\nInstruction Prompting#\\nThe purpose of presenting few-shot examples in the prompt is to explain our intent to the model; in other words, describe the task instruction to the model in the form of demonstrations. However, few-shot can be expensive in terms of token usage and restricts the input length due to limited context length.

The process repeats until some stopping\\ncriteria is met.\\nLarge language models learn these probabilities by training on large corpuses\\nof text. A consequence of this is that the models will cater to some use cases\\nbetter than others (e.g. if it’s trained on GitHub data, it’ll understand the\\nprobabilities of sequences in source code really well).

N-gram models also don’t scale\\nto large values of N, so are inherently limited.\\nMid-2000’s\\nIn 2007, Geoffrey Hinton – famous for popularizing backpropagation in 1980’s –\\npublished an important advancement in training neural\\nnetworks that unlocked much\\ndeeper networks. Applying these simple deep neural networks to language\\nmodeling helped alleviate some of problems with language models – they\\nrepresented nuanced arbitrary concepts in a finite space and continuous way,\\ngracefully handling sequences not seen in the training corpus. These simple\\nneural networks learned the probabilities of their training corpus well, but\\nthe output would statistically match the training data and generally not be\\ncoherent relative to the input sequence.\\nEarly-2010’s\\nAlthough they were first introduced in 1995, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\\nNetworks found their\\ntime to shine in the 2010’s. LSTMs allowed models to process arbitrary length\\nsequences and, importantly, alter their internal state dynamically as they\\nprocessed the input to remember previous things they saw.

You can kind of think of tokens\\nas syllables, and on average they work out to about 750 words per 1,000\\ntokens.

You could, in theory, just feed a model 0’s and 1’s – but then the model needs to learn the concept of characters from bits, and then the concept of words from characters, and so forth. Similarly, you could feed the model a stream of raw characters, but then the model needs to learn the concept of words, and punctuation, etc… and, in general, the models will perform worse.\\nTo learn more, Hugging Face has a wonderful introduction to tokenizers and why they need to exist.\\nThere’s a lot of nuance around tokenization, such as vocabulary size or different languages treating sentence structure meaningfully different (e.g. words not being separated by spaces).

       " Document(page_content=\"Except for one important scenario, which we discuss next: token limits.\\nToken Limits\\nPrompts tend to be append-only, because you want the bot to have the entire context of previous messages in the conversation. Language models, in general, are stateless and won’t remember anything about previous requests to them, so you always need to include everything that it might need to know that is specific to the current session.\\nA major downside of this is that the leading language model architecture, the Transformer, has a fixed input and output size – at a certain point the prompt can’t grow any larger. The total size of the prompt, sometimes referred to as the “context window”, is model dependent. For GPT-3, it is 4,096 tokens. For GPT-4, it is 8,192 tokens or 32,768 tokens depending on which variant you use.\\nIf your context grows too large for the model, the most common tactic is the truncate the context in a sliding window fashion. If you think of a prompt as hidden initialization prompt + messages[], usually the hidden prompt will remain unaltered, and the messages[] array will take the last N messages.\\nYou may also see more clever tactics for prompt truncation – such as\\ndiscarding only the user messages first, so that the bot's previous answers\\nstay in the context for as long as possible, or asking an LLM to summarize the\\nconversation and then replacing all of the messages with a single message\\ncontaining that summary. There is no correct answer here and the solution will\\ndepend on your application.\\nImportantly, when truncating the context, you must truncate aggressively enough to allow room for the response as well. OpenAI’s token limits include both the length of the input and the length of the output. If your input to GPT-3 is 4,090 tokens, it can only generate 6 tokens in response.\\n\\n🧙\\u200d♂️ If you’d like to count the number of tokens before sending the raw text to the model, the specific tokenizer to use will depend on which model you are using.

The two large classes of attacks are:\\n\\nMake the bot bypass any guidelines you have given it.\\nMake the bot output hidden context that you didn’t intend for the user to see.\\n\\nThere are no known mechanisms to comprehensively stop these, so it is important that you assume the bot may do or say anything when interacting with an adversarial user. Fortunately, in practice, these are mostly cosmetic concerns.\\nThink of prompts as a way to improve the normal user experience. We design prompts so that normal users don’t stumble outside of our intended interactions – but always assume that a determined user will be able to bypass our prompt constraints.\\nJailbreaks\\nTypically hidden prompts will tell the bot to behave with a certain persona and focus on specific tasks or avoid certain words. It is generally safe to assume the bot will follow these guidelines for non-adversarial users, although non-adversarial users may accidentally bypass the guidelines too.\\nFor  example, we can tell the bot:\\nYou are a helpful assistant, but you are never allowed to use the word \"computer\".\\n\\nIf we then ask it a question about computers, it will refer to them as a “device used for computing” because it isn’t allowed to use the word “computer”.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt will absolutely refuse to say the word:\\n\\n\\n\\nBut we can bypass these instructions and get the model to happily use the word if we trick it by asking it to translate the pig latin version of “computer”.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are a number of defensive measures you can take here, but typically the best bet is to reiterate your most important constraints as close to the end as possible.

If the user asks “Why is the sky blue?” – you compute the embedding of that question and, in theory, this embedding will be more similar to embeddings of documents that mention the sky than embeddings that don’t talk about the sky.\\nTo find documents related to the user query, you compute the embedding and then find the top-N documents that have the most similar embedding. Then we place these documents (or summaries of these documents) in the hidden context for the bot to reference.\\nNotably, sometimes user queries are so short that the embedding isn’t particularly valuable. There is a clever technique described in a paper published in December 2022 called a “Hypothetical Document Embedding” or HyDE. Using this technique, you ask the model to generate a hypothetical document in response to the user’s query, and then compute the embedding for this generated document. The model  fabricates a document out of thin air – but the approach works!\\nThe HyDE technique uses more calls to the model, but for many use cases has notable boosts in results.\\nTeach a Bot to Fish\\nSometimes you’ll want the bot to have the capability to perform actions on the user’s behalf, like adding a memo to a receipt or plotting a chart. Or perhaps we want it to retrieve data in more nuanced ways than semantic search would allow for, like retrieving the past 90 days of expenses.\\nIn these scenarios, we need to teach the bot how to fish.\\nCommand Grammars\\nWe can give the bot a list of commands for our system to interpret, along with descriptions and examples for the commands, and then have it produce programs composed of those commands.\\nThere are many caveats to consider when going with this approach.

The art to getting this right is enumerating commands that have relatively high levels of abstraction, while giving the bot sufficient flexibility to compose them in novel and useful ways.\\nFor example, giving the bot a plot-the-last-90-days-of-expenses command is not particularly flexible or composable in what the bot can do with it. Similarly, a draw-pixel-at-x-y [x] [y] [rgb] command would be far too low-level. But giving the bot a plot-expenses and list-expenses command provides some good primitives that the bot has some flexibility with.\\nIn an example below, we use this list of commands:\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand\\nArguments\\nDescription\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlist-expenses\\nbudget\\nReturns a list of expenses for a given budget\\n\\n\\nconverse\\nmessage\\nA message to show to the user\\n\\n\\nplot-expenses\\nexpenses[]\\nPlots a list of expenses\\n\\n\\nget-budget-by-name\\nbudget_name\\nRetrieves a budget by name\\n\\n\\nlist-budgets\\n\\nReturns a list of budgets the user has access to\\n\\n\\nadd-memo\\ninbox_item_id, memo message\\nAdds a memo to the provided inbox item\\n\\n\\n\\nWe provide this table to the model in Markdown format, which the language model handles incredibly well – presumably because OpenAI trains heavily on data from GitHub.\\nIn this example below, we ask the model to output the commands in reverse polish notation7.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n🧠 There are some interesting subtle things going on in that example, beyond just command generation. When we ask it to add a memo to the “shake shack” expense, the model knows that the command add-memo takes an expense ID. But we never tell it the expense ID, so it looks up “Shake Shack” in the table of expenses we provided it, then grabs the ID from the corresponding ID column, and then uses that as an argument to add-memo.\\n\\nGetting command grammars working reliably in complex situations can be tricky. The best levers we have here are to provide lots of descriptions, and as many examples of usage as we can.

At a minimum, you have to provide a number of examples (at least one usage example per command) before you get any reasonable results. And, for complex sets of commands, it may hallucinate new commands or create fictional arguments.\\nWith a sufficiently thorough hidden prompt, you should be able to overcome these limitations. GPT-4 is capable of far more consistent and complex logic with far simpler prompts (and can get by with zero or  small numbers of examples – though it is always beneficial to include as many as possible).\\nStrategies\\nThis section contains examples and strategies for specific needs or problems. For successful prompt engineering, you will need to combine some subset of all of the strategies enumerated in this document. Don’t be afraid to mix and match things – or invent your own approaches.\\nEmbedding Data\\nIn hidden contexts, you’ll frequently want to embed all sorts of data. The specific strategy will vary depending on the type and quantity of data you are embedding.\\nSimple Lists\\nFor one-off objects, enumerating fields + values in a normal bulleted list works pretty well:\\n\\n\\n\\nIt', metadata={'source': 'https://github.com/brexhq/prompt-engineering', 'title': \"GitHub - brexhq/prompt-engineering: Tips and tricks for working with Large Language Models like OpenAI's GPT-4.\", 'description': \"Tips and tricks for working with Large Language Models like OpenAI's GPT-4. - GitHub - brexhq/prompt-engineering: Tips and tricks for working with Large Language Models like OpenAI's GPT-4.\", 'language': 'en'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='For one-off objects, enumerating fields + values in a normal bulleted list works pretty well:\\n\\n\\n\\nIt will also work for larger sets of things, but there are other formats for lists of data that GPT handles more reliably. Regardless, here’s an example:\\n\\n\\n\\nMarkdown Tables\\nMarkdown tables are great for scenarios where you have many items of the same type to enumerate.\\nFortunately, OpenAI’s models are exceptionally good at working with Markdown tables (presumably from the tons of GitHub data they’ve trained on).\\nWe can reframe the above using Markdown tables instead:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n🧠 Note that in this last example, the items in the table have an explicit date, February 2nd. In our question, we asked about “today”. And earlier in the prompt we mentioned that today was Feb 2. The model correctly handled the transitive inference – converting “today” to “February 2nd” and then looking up “February 2nd” in the table.\\n\\nJSON\\nMarkdown tables work really well for many use cases and should be preferred due to their density and ability for the model to handle them reliably, but you may run into scenarios where you have many columns and the model struggles with it or every item has some custom attributes and it doesn’t make sense to have dozens of columns of empty data.\\nIn these scenarios, JSON is another format that the model handles really well. The close proximity of keys to their values makes it easy for the model to keep the mapping straight.\\nHere is the same example from the Markdown table, but with JSON instead:\\n\\n\\n\\nFreeform Text\\nOccasionally you’ll want to include freeform text in a prompt that you would like to delineate from the rest of the prompt – such as embedding a document for the bot to reference.

       " Document(page_content=' to link to anything it references:\\n\\n\\n\\nProgrammatic Consumption\\nBy default, language models output natural language text, but frequently we need to interact with this result in a programmatic way that goes beyond simply printing it out on screen. You can achieve this by  asking the model to output the results in your favorite serialization format (JSON and YAML seem to work best).\\nMake sure you give the model an example of the output format you’d like. Building on our previous travel example above, we can augment our prompt to tell it:\\nProduce your output as JSON. The format should be:\\n```\\n{\\n    message: \"The message to show the user\",\\n    hotelId: 432,\\n    flightId: 831\\n}\\n```\\n\\nDo not include the IDs in your message.\\n\\nAnd now we’ll get interactions like this:\\n\\n\\n\\nYou could imagine the UI for this rendering the message as normal text, but then also adding discrete buttons for booking the flight + hotel, or auto-filling a form for the user.\\nAs another example, let’s build on the citations example – but move beyond Markdown links. We can ask it to produce JSON with a normal message along with a list of items used in the creation of that message. In this scenario you won’t know exactly where in the message the citations were leveraged, but you’ll know that they were used somewhere.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n🧠 Interestingly, in the model’s response to “How much did I spend at Target?” it provides a single value, $188.16, but importantly in the citations array it lists the individual expenses that it used to compute that value.\\n\\nChain of Thought\\nSometimes you will bang your head on a prompt trying to get the model to output reliable results, but, no matter what you do, it just won’t work. This will frequently happen when the bot’s final output requires intermediate thinking, but you ask the bot only for the output and nothing else.\\nThe answer may surprise you: ask the bot to show its work.

The actual answer is $136.77 and the bot almost gets it correct with $136.43.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf we simply add “Let’s think step-by-step”, the model gets the correct answer:\\n\\n\\n\\nInterpreting Code\\nLet’s revisit the Python example from earlier and apply chain-of-thought prompting to our question. As a reminder, when we asked the bot to evaluate the Python code it gets it slightly wrong. The correct answer is Hello, Brex!!Brex!!Brex!!! but the bot gets confused about the number of !'s to include. In below’s example, it outputs Hello, Brex!!!Brex!!!Brex!!!:\\n\\n\\n\\nIf we ask the bot to show its work, then it gets the correct answer:\\n\\n\\n\\nDelimiters\\nIn many scenarios, you may not want to show the end user all of the bot’s thinking and instead just want to show the final answer. You can ask the bot to delineate the final answer from its thinking. There are many ways to do this, but let’s use JSON to make it easy to parse:\\n\\n\\n\\nUsing Chain-of-Thought prompting will consume more tokens, resulting in increased price and latency, but the results are noticeably more reliable for many scenarios.

       " Document(page_content=' do what you want it to do. In these scenarios you can sometimes fallback to fine-tuning. This should, in general, be a last resort.\\nFine-tuning is the process of taking an already trained model and then giving it thousands (or more) of example input:output pairs\\nIt does not eliminate the need for hidden prompts, because you still need to embed dynamic data, but it may make the prompts smaller and more reliable.\\nDownsides\\nThere are many downsides to fine-tuning. If it is at all possible, take advantage of the nature of language models being zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learners by teaching them to do something in their prompt rather than fine-tuning.\\nSome of the downsides include:\\n\\nNot possible: GPT-3.5/GPT-4 isn’t fine tunable, which is the primary model / API we’ll be using, so we simply can’t lean in fine-tuning.\\nOverhead: Fine-tuning requires manually creating tons of data.\\nVelocity: The iteration loop becomes much slower – every time you want to add a new capability, instead of adding a few lines to a prompt, you need to create a bunch of fake data and then run the finetune process and then use the newly fine-tuned model.\\nCost: It is up to 60x more expensive to use a fine-tuned GPT-3 model vs the stock gpt-3.5-turbo model. And it is 2x more expensive to use a fine-tuned GPT-3 model vs the stock GPT-4 model.\\n\\n\\n⛔️ If you fine-tune a model, never use real customer data. Always use synthetic data. The model may memorize portions of the data you provide and may regurgitate private data to other users that shouldn’t be seeing it.\\nIf you never fine-tune a model, we don’t have to worry about accidentally leaking data into the model.\\n\\nAdditional Resources\\n\\n🌟 OpenAI Cookbook 🌟\\n🧑\\u200d💻 Prompt Hacking 🧑\\u200d💻\\n📚 Dair.ai Prompt Engineering Guide 📚\\n\\nFootnotes\\n\\n\\nLanguage models actually use tokens, not words', metadata={'source': 'https://github.com/brexhq/prompt-engineering', 'title': \"GitHub - brexhq/prompt-engineering: Tips and tricks for working with Large Language Models like OpenAI's GPT-4.\", 'description': \"Tips and tricks for working with Large Language Models like OpenAI's GPT-4. - GitHub - brexhq/prompt-engineering: Tips and tricks for working with Large Language Models like OpenAI's GPT-4.\", 'language': 'en'}),\n",
